 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

 Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

 A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].

  

 Example 1:

 Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
 Output: 4
 Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
 Example 2:

 Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
 Output: 4
 Example 3:

 Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
 Output: 1
  

 Constraints:

 1 <= nums.length <= 2500
 -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
  

 Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(n log(n)) time complexity?
