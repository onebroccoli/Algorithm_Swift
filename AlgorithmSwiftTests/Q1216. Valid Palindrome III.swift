 1216. Valid Palindrome III

 Given a string s and an integer k, return true if s is a k-palindrome.

 A string is k-palindrome if it can be transformed into a palindrome by removing at most k characters from it.

  

 Example 1:

 Input: s = "abcdeca", k = 2
 Output: true
 Explanation: Remove 'b' and 'e' characters.
 Example 2:

 Input: s = "abbababa", k = 1
 Output: true
  

 Constraints:

 1 <= s.length <= 1000
 s consists of only lowercase English letters.
 1 <= k <= s.length
