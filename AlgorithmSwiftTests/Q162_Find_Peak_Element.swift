 162. Find Peak Element

 A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

 Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

 You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

 You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

  

 Example 1:

 Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
 Output: 2
 Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
 Example 2:

 Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
 Output: 5
 Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
  

 Constraints:

 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
 -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
 nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.
