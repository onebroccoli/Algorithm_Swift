 272. Closest Binary Search Tree Value II
 Given the root of a binary search tree, a target value, and an integer k, return the k values in the BST that are closest to the target. You may return the answer in any order.
 You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.
  
 Example 1:

 Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286, k = 2
 Output: [4,3]

 Example 2:
 Input: root = [1], target = 0.000000, k = 1
 Output: [1]

  
 Constraints:
 The number of nodes in the tree is n.
 1 <= k <= n <= 104.
 0 <= Node.val <= 109
 -109 <= target <= 109
  
 Follow up: Assume that the BST is balanced. Could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?


 Hide Hint 1
 Consider implement these two helper functions:
 getPredecessor(N), which returns the next smaller node to N.
 getSuccessor(N), which returns the next larger node to N.
 Hide Hint 2
 Try to assume that each node has a parent pointer, it makes the problem much easier.
 Hide Hint 3
 Without parent pointer we just need to keep track of the path from the root to the current node using a stack.
 Hide Hint 4
 You would need two stacks to track the path in finding predecessor and successor node separately.

 Solution:
 Given target value is a floating point
 You can assume that k always valid, namely: kâ‰¤ total node.
